    <h1>Global Shapers Copenhagen</h1>

    <p>The World Economic Forum established Global Shapers as a special community of extraordinary young people in their 20s. The community provides young leaders with a global platform to shape the future — integrating the personal, community and global dimensions of leadership.</p>

    <p>Through the unparalleled convening power of the World Economic Forum, the Global Shapers Community is diverse in demographics, geographical areas and sectors.
    However, it is united by a common desire to channel members’ tremendous energy and enthusiasm into building a more peaceful and inclusive world.</p>

    <p>In the Global Shapers Copenhagen hub our effort to create social impact is centered around four annual workshops, where we engage in advising and consulting social project being small or big.</p>

 <h2>Examples on what we do</h2>

    <p><b>Mind Your Own Business</b>: Help troubled teenage boys from Danish ghettos to turn their street savviness into becoming successful business entrepreneurs. Made in collaboration with Danish Refugee Council and Boston Consulting Group.</p>
 
<p><b>Project Home</b>: Give refugee kids a warm welcome to the Danish society through an interactive theater experience, connecting with the kids through an Arabic version of H.C. Andersen’s fairy tales. Collaboration with Rokoko and The Coca-Cola Company.</p>
 
<p><b>Kids on Vacation</b>: Initiative to make sure all Danish kids gets the opportunity to go on a vacation, which is unfortunately not the case for around 60.000 Danish kids. We are in the process of finding the right collaborators to make the project happen.</p>
 
<p><b>Sexelancen</b>: Highlighting the though conditions of street sex workers often violated and threatened by customers through establishing a “sex ambulance” with more dignity, safety and security.
